Docker Compose
---------------
Used to deploy multiple containers at the same time, that generally work together
- It needs a "configuration file" called docker-compose.yaml
- .yaml is a 'Data Serialization Language'
- Containers go under the "services" section


Commands:
- To run a docker-compose(d-c) file, being inside the d-c dir
  $ docker-compose up -d
- To stop & eliminate all containers created
  $ docker-compose down
- To only stop the created containers
  $ docker-compose stop
- To check active containers
  $ docker-compose ps
