Docker Compose
---------------
Used to deploy multiple containers at the same time, that generally work together
- It needs a "configuration file" called docker-compose.yaml
- .yaml is a 'Data Serialization Language'
- It automatically takes care of Networking
- Containers go under the "services" section
- Required attributes of a docker-compose file
  + version: '3.1'  # version of docker-compose compatible with local version
  + services:  # containers that you want to run in this file
    > mongodb: # container name, must be lowercase
    >  image:  # image to build the container will be built from
    >  ports:  # list of port mappings 
        - host:container
    >  environment:  # environment variables
    >  dependes_on:  # apps that need to be run first, before running this app
- for the name, d-c prepends the containing folder name, and adds a postfix a number


Commands:
- If you already have DockerDesktop, you can run d-c with:
  $ docker compose vesion  # to check the version for example
- To run a docker-compose(d-c) file, being inside the d-c dir
  $ docker-compose up -d  # -d == detached mode, from the terminal
  or
  $ docker-compose -f mongo-services.yaml up
  - ... -f ,  file, to specify a custom compose file
  - ... -d ,  detached mode
  - ... -p ,  project-name, to change the prefix for the containers
  - ... --build ,  to pre-build the docker image
- To stop & eliminate all containers created
  $ docker-compose <yamlfile> down
- To only stop the created containers
  $ docker-compose <yaml> stop
- To only start again all the created containers
  $ docker-compose <yaml> start
- To check active containers
  $ docker-compose <yaml> ps
