~~~~~~~~~~ Install Docker ~~~~~~~~~~
* https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04
1. Update existing list of packages
  $ sudo apt update
2. Install prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS
  $ sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
3. Add the GPG key for the official Docker repository to your system
  $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
4. Add the Docker repository to APT sources. This will also update our package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo.
  $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
5. Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo
  $ apt-cache policy docker-ce
  // The 'focal' is the important part to see in output: Candidate: 5:27.3.1-1~ubuntu.20.04~focal
6. Finally, install Docker
  $ sudo apt install docker-ce
// Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot.
7. Check that it’s running
  $ sudo systemctl status docker
...
~~~~~~~ Install Docker Desktop ~~~~~~~
//If not available, you can use https://app.docker.com
8. After the above you can now install Docker Desktop without downloading the .deb file
  $ sudo apt-get install docker-desktop
  // at the end it displays a download error, you can ignore it
  //For Upgrades, yuo need to download pckg and install again
9. Load Virtualization Support module manually, with KVM (if it didn't load automatically)
  $ modprobe kvm
10. Load the module for the corresponding processor
  $ modprobe kvm_intel  // depending on the processor,  modprobe kvm_amd
  // If there are any errors, check in Bios if Virtualization Support is Enabled
11. Check diagnostics if the above command fails
  $ kvm-ok
12. Check if the KVM modules are enabled
  $ lsmod | grep kvm
Set up KVM device user permissions
13. To check ownership of /dev/kvm
  $ ls -al /dev/kvm
14. Add your user to the kvm group in order to access the kvm device
  $ sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
15. Sign out and sign back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated. Then Launch DD.

• Docker apps are built in layers
• Docker and Kernel are virtualization tools
• Docker virtalizaes the ApplicationLayer, and uses the host kernel
• VM virtualizes the whole OSkernel
• Docker Workflow
  + Docker Client: UserInterface for interacting with Docker; terminal or GUI
  + Docker Host(Daemon): Backgroudn process responsible for managing containers on the host system.
  + Docker Registry(DockerHub): is the centralized repositry of docker images
• 

• Commands
  $ docker [option] [command] [arguments]
  $ docker ps  , show running containers
  $ docker run postgres:10.10  , run a specific version of an image in a new container
	...    from  , specifies the base image to use for the new image
	...    workdir  , to set working directory
	...    copy  , copy files from build context to image
	...    run  , execute commands in the shell during image build; to create a container
	...    expose  , inform ports to use(listen to)
	...    env  , to set environment variables
	...    arg  , defines build time variables
	...    volume  , creates a mountpoint for externally mounted volumes (for ext storage)
	...    cmd  , provides default(flexible) commands to execute when the container starts
	...    entrypoint  , defines default(fixed) executable to run when the container starts
	...	   pull  , download and install an image on our machine

  $ cat /etc/issue  , to know the version of the linux system   //Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
  $ echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP  , to know which desktop environment I am using
  $ docker run -it ubuntu  , to create a container with the ubuntu image
  	-it  , is for 'interactive'
